**`SSH protocol`** enables systems to communicate in an encrypted and secure manner,over an
insecure network.
- You can use the ssh command to create a secure connection to a remote system, authenticate
as a specific user, and get an interactive shell session on the remote system as that user. You may
also use the ssh command to run an individual command on the remote system without running
an interactive shell.
