## **`Infrastructure As Code`**:


- Good automation system allows you to implement Infrastructure as Code practices. 
- *Infrastructure as Code* can be described as using machine-readable automation language to define, and describe the state you want your **`IT`** infrastructure to be in. 
- This code is then applied to your infrastructure to ensure that it is actually in that state.
- Ideally, you want an automation language that can be easily read and understood by humans, because then you can easily understand what the state is and make changes to it. 
- If the automation language is represented as simple text files, it can easily be managed in a version control system. The advantage of this is that every change can be checked into the version control system, ensuring that you have a history of the changes you make over time. If you want to revert to an earlier known-good configuration, you can check out that version and apply it to your infrastructure.

## **`What is Ansible ?`**:

Ansible is an open source automation platform. It is a simple automation language that can perfectly describe an IT application infrastructure in Ansible Playbooks. It is also an automation engine that runs Ansible Playbooks.
Ansible can manage powerful automation tasks and can adapt to many different workflows and environments. At the same time, new users of Ansible can very quickly use it to become productive.
