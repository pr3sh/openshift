## **`Infrastructure as Code`**:

- Good automation system allows you to implement Infrastructure as Code practices. 
- *Infrastructure as Code* can be described as using machine-readable automation language to define, and describe the state you want your ***`IT`*** infrastructure to be in. 
- This code is then applied to your infrastructure to ensure that it is actually in that state.
- Ideally, you want an automation language that can be easily read and understood by humans, because then you can easily understand what the state is and make changes to it. 
- If the automation language is represented as simple text files, it can easily be managed in a version control system.
- This ensures that every change is tracked, and can be reverted to if need be.
- Consequently, it builds a foundation to help you follow best practices in **`DevOps`**. 
  - Developers can define their desired configuration in the automation language. Operators can review those changes more easily to provide feedback, and use that automation to reproducibly ensure that systems are in the state expected by the developers.

## **`What is Ansible ?`**:

- Ansible is an *open source* automation platform. 
- It is a simple automation language that can perfectly describe an ***`IT`*** application infrastructure in **`Ansible Playbooks`**. 
- It is also an automation engine that runs **`Ansible Playbooks`**.
- Ansible can manage powerful automation tasks and can adapt to many different workflows and environments.
