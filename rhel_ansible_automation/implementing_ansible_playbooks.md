## **`Defining the Inventory`**:

- An inventory defines a collection of hosts that Ansible needs to manage. 
These hosts can also be assigned to groups, which can be managed collectively. 
- *Groups* can contain child groups, and hosts can be members of multiple groups. 
- Host inventories can be defined in two different ways. A static host inventory can be defined by a text file. A dynamic host inventory can be generated by a script or other program as needed, using external information providers.
