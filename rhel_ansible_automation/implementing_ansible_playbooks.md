## **`Defining the Inventory`**:

- An inventory defines a collection of hosts that Ansible needs to manage. 
These hosts can also be assigned to groups, which can be managed collectively. 
- *Groups* can contain child groups, and hosts can be members of multiple groups. 
- Host inventories can be defined in two different ways:
  1. A *static* host inventory can be defined by a text file. 
  2. A *dynamic* host inventory can be generated by a script.


## **`Specifying Managed Hosts with a Static Inventory`**:

- A static inventory file is a text file that specifies the managed hosts that Ansible targets. 
- This fie can be written in a number of different formats, including **`INI-style`** or **`YAML`**.
