# **`Abstract`**

Understanding how  to create an inventory of managed hosts, write a simple Ansible Playbook, and run the playbook to automate tasks on those hosts.

  - [Specifying Managed Hosts with a Static Inventory](#specifying-managed-hostss-with-a-static-inventory)


## **`Defining the Inventory`**:

- An inventory defines a collection of hosts that Ansible needs to manage. 
These hosts can also be assigned to groups, which can be managed collectively. 
- *Groups* can contain child groups, and hosts can be members of multiple groups. 
- Host inventories can be defined in two different ways:
  1. A *static* host inventory can be defined by a text file. 
  2. A *dynamic* host inventory can be generated by a script.


## **`Specifying Managed Hosts with a Static Inventory`**:

- A static inventory file is a text file that specifies the managed hosts that Ansible targets. 
- This fie can be written in a number of different formats, including **`INI-style`** or **`YAML`**. 

```text
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com
192.0.2.42

[db-servers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com

[east-datacenter]
web1.example.com
db1.example.com

[west-datacenter]
web2.example.com
db2.example.com

[production]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com
db1.example.com
db2.example.com

[development]
192.0.2.42
```

As illustrated above, managed hosts have been organized into groups. It is important to know that *two* groups always exist.
 - The **`all`** group, which contains every host explicitly listed in the inventory.
 - The **`ungroupd`** host group, which refers to managed hosts listed in the inventory that aren't part of a group.
