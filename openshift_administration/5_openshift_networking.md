### **`Introduction `**:

OpenShift implements a software-defined to effectively manage the network infrastructure of the cluster and user applications. This networking model that allows for easy managemet of network services through the abstraction of several networking layers. It decouples the software that handles the traffic (**`control-plane)`**, along with the underlying mechanisms that route the traffic (**`data plane`**). OpenShift's SDN aligs with *open standards*, that enable vendors to propose their solutions, centralized management, dynamic routing, and tenant isolation.
